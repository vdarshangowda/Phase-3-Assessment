                                                    Chat Log Application

Details:-


1.Created a folder named Chat-Log and inside that all the stuffs has Done.

2.Nodejs allows the modules of libraries to be included in the application. These modules can be user-defined or third party modules.
==>The third party modules can be installed using the following command:
*npm install express
*npm install socket.io
*npm install http



3. The installed modules can be used using the require() function:
==>const express = require('express');
==>const http = require('http').Server(app);
==>const io = require('socket.io')(http);

4.In Node apps we will be using a package.json file to maintain the module versions. This file can be created by this command:

==>npm init

5.Next we will create a app.js file.

In this file we need to require Express and create a reference to a variable from an instance of Express.
Static contents like HTML, CSS or JavaScript can be served using express.js

6. we can start listening to a port using the port number==> localhost:3000

7. When we run the localhost :3000 our chat application will appear and start chat with different users.

8. When user connect to the chat app it will display user connected and when user exit from the chat browser user gets disconnected.

9. The chats which users make in the chat browser will store in the mongodb database.

10. We can fetch the chat data from the database.
